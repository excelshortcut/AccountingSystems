Overview

AP links Subcontractors to Vendors. PCA Assigns Workforce to Subcontractors.

We will create an exception report that will replace items 2 and 4 below, helping close disconnects between the groups. 

AP does the Setup

AP notifies Project Control when a Sub Vendor is setup so that workforce can be assigned

 PCA Assigns the Workforce

AP Notifies Project Control when they are going to do Vendor Runs, but no one is in the workforce

 

Description of the New Report

This Scheduled report will send to PCA on regular intervals to show Linked Subcontractors that do not have Workforce Assigned.

Itâ€™s an Exception Report, so we can later add other scenarios that might hold up Subcontractor Processing (however, not if it's on a step that Laurentz Curtis is responsible for)
